# Library-Management-System
Design a relational database for a library to track books, authors, members, borrowing transactions, and late fees. This project will demonstrate skills in database creation, data manipulation, and SQL querying.

## Steps for the Project
## 1. **Database Creation and Schema Design**

Create a database named "LibraryManagementSystem". Then, design tables to capture relevant information:

- **Books**: Stores information about each book.
- **Authors**: Stores information about authors who wrote the books.
- **Members**: Stores information about library members.
- **BorrowingRecords**: Tracks the borrowing and return status of books.
- **LateFees**: Tracks fees for overdue books.
